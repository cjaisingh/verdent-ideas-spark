# Changelog

All notable changes to AWIP Core. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Dates are when the change landed in the operator-facing build.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Sidebar redesign** — left navigation now has a per-operator **Favorites** section at the top (hover any row → click the star to pin, max 6, persisted in `localStorage`) and a collapsible **Copilot** subgroup under Operate (Agents / Profile / Lessons / Transcripts) that auto-opens when you're inside `/copilot/*`. Single restrained palette: monochrome icons, one active treatment per row (fill + 2px left border), and right-aligned status dots driven only by real signals (pending `approval_queue` rows on `/admin`, recent `night_observations` on `/night-shifts`). New `src/lib/sidebar-state.ts` hooks (`useFavorites`, `useCopilotOpen`, `useStatusDots`). See `docs/operator-sidebar.md`.
- **Operator pane toggles** — header now has a 4-mode pane row (Cursor-style): `left only`, `dual` (left + right Night Agent feed), `centre` (focus, all panes closed), `bottom` (left + live event ticker). Switch via icon row or `⌘1`–`⌘4`. Right pane streams the latest 30 `night_observations` in real time with a UTC night-window status dot. Bottom pane merges `okr_node_events` + `capability_events` + `discussion_action_events` (capped at 200, pause/resume, source tabs). Mode is persisted per top-level route in `localStorage` under `awip.panes.v1`. Mobile (<768px) is forced to centre. See `docs/operator-panes.md`.
- **Promotion audit report** — admin page at `/admin/promotion-audits` and a drawer reachable from `/night-shifts` show the exact before/after of every operator-confirmed Night Agent promotion: open-time gate snapshot, shift-level skip reasons, and the selected/skipped candidates list. New `awip-api` endpoint `GET /night-agent/promotion-audit?proposal_id=…|shift_id=…` (admin-only). Pure assembler + 5 Deno tests in `supabase/functions/awip-api/promotion_audit.ts`. `night-agent/open` now persists `gates`, `candidates_selected`, `candidates_skipped` on `night_shifts.summary` and stamps each `night_proposals.payload` with `gates_snapshot_ref` + `selected_at`. Legacy shifts without a snapshot are flagged `legacy: true` instead of failing. See `docs/promotion-audit.md`.
- **Capability Phase-3 promotion workflow** — admin page at `/admin/capability-promotion` evaluates 8 maturity gates per capability (manifest, inputs/outputs, connector wiring, dependency resolution, OKR demand, Phase-3 QA, open approvals, current status) and shows the failure reason and operator action for each. New `awip-api` endpoints `GET /capabilities/promotion-status`, `GET /capabilities/:id/promotion-status`, `POST /capabilities/:id/promote`, `POST /capabilities/:id/ack-warnings` (admin-only, idempotent). Pure evaluator + Deno tests in `supabase/functions/awip-api/promotion_gates.ts`. New `capability_events` types `promoted_to_available` and `warnings_acknowledged`. Promotion banner added to `/capabilities/:id`. See `docs/capability-promotion.md`.
- **Task approval workflow** — `roadmap_tasks` gains `review_status` (pending / approved / rejected / changes_requested), `reviewed_by`, `reviewed_at`, `review_notes`. New append-only `roadmap_task_reviews` table records every decision with a snapshot of the checklist state, reviewer, and notes. New `TaskApprovalPanel` on `/roadmap` lets operators approve / request changes / reject / reopen a task; rejection requires notes; approving with an incomplete checklist prompts confirmation. Status pill is shown inline on each task row. History view exposes the full audit trail. Operator-only RLS (insert + read; no edit/delete on history).
- **Per-task review checklist** — new `roadmap_task_checklist` table + `ReviewChecklistEditor` on `/roadmap` task panels. Operators can seed the standard review template (acceptance line, RLS migration, no plaintext secrets, events emitted, idempotency replay, CHANGELOG, sources, risk flags) or add custom items, tick them off (records `checked_by` + `checked_at`), add per-item notes, and attach scoped research evidence per checklist item via the existing `EvidencePanel`. Operator-only RLS + realtime + progress bar.
- **Research evidence on roadmap tasks** — new `roadmap_task_evidence` table + private `roadmap-evidence` storage bucket. Each evidence row links a task (and optional checklist item key) to a URL, uploaded file, or note, with title, source citation, and `added_by` for auditability. Surfaced on `/roadmap` task panels via the new `EvidencePanel` component (realtime). Operator-only RLS on both table and bucket; uploaded files served via short-lived signed URLs.
- **Daily plan** — `daily-plan` edge function (cron `30 5 * * *`) summarises open roadmap tasks, recent work-log activity, unresolved findings, failing QA probes, recent test runs, and pinned notebook entries via Lovable AI Gateway (`openai/gpt-5`) into `daily_plans` (one per day). Surfaced in the new **Daily plan** card on `/roadmap` with focus, plan markdown, risks, and recommendations. Operator-only RLS + realtime.
- **Phase 5 / 6 / 6b roadmap expansion** — added 9 new sprints (s5.2, s5.3, s6.2–s6.6, s6b.2, s6b.3) and ~50 tasks covering entity resolution, canonical ingest spine, source adapters, conflict layer, PII/DSAR, RAG, compliance hooks, and operator SLAs. Tasks carry one-line acceptance criteria sourced from the pinned notebook research.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-06 — Operator observability & automation

### Added
- **Scheduled AI code review** — `scheduled-code-review` edge function (weekly `pg_cron`) summarises the last 7 days of git diff via Lovable AI Gateway (`google/gemini-2.5-pro`) into `roadmap_review_findings`. UI: click-to-expand findings with file/line context; filter by severity / acknowledged; sort by date or severity.
- **Nightly tests** — `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` runs vitest unit + e2e at 02:00 UTC and POSTs results to `record-test-run` → `test_runs`. UI: per-run list with status filter and last-run chip.
- **QA probes** — `qa-validate` edge function runs phase-success-criterion checks against `qa_checks`. UI: progress bar + per-check expand showing pass/fail criteria and last note.
- **Failure alerts** — `alert_settings` / `alert_log` tables and inline `dispatchAlert` helper wired into all three jobs. Configurable Slack/Discord/custom webhook with per-reason toggles (`alert_on_review_error`, `alert_on_high_finding`, `alert_on_test_fail`, `alert_on_qa_fail`), dedupe window, send-test button, and realtime delivery log in the Automation card.
- **Runbook page** — new `/runbook` route consolidates open high/medium findings, failed test runs, failing QA probes, and recent alert deliveries into a single triage view with one-click acknowledge.
- `docs/automation.md` — full reference for the four automation jobs, payload shape, Slack/Discord/custom-receiver setup, and operator workflow.
- README links to the automation doc and `/runbook` page.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-06 — Security documentation

### Added
- `docs/security.md` — full security reference: identities & roles, RLS policy matrix for every table, the `authorize()` flow in the edge function, service-token trust model between sibling Lovable projects (with rotation steps), idempotency as a replay defence, audit-log conventions, and a quarterly operator review checklist.
- README link to the new security doc alongside architecture, API, and development docs.

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-06 — Local development guide

### Added
- `docs/development.md` — step-by-step local setup: Node/bun prerequisites, every required env var (frontend `VITE_*` and backend secrets), migration paths (Lovable agent vs local Supabase CLI) with the "never edit `types.ts`/`auth`/`storage`/etc." rules, edge-function deploy + `curl` invocation patterns, Vitest/Deno test commands, common workflows (add endpoint, add column, promote capability), and a troubleshooting section for the recurring 401 / stale-lock / `CHECK now()` issues.
- README link to the development guide.

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-06 — Architecture overview

### Added
- `docs/architecture.md` — mental model ("Core is a substrate, not a brain"), the two halves of the data model (OKR tree + capability manifest), the two event streams (`okr_node_events`, `capability_events`) and how they merge in `GET /events/recent`, how the operator UI vs Control Plane consume the system, the four load-bearing invariants, and the project-boundary contract for Discovery AI / Control Plane / future module projects.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-06 — API reference

### Added
- `docs/api.md` — complete reference for all 9 `/awip-api` endpoints with request/response examples, query params, and error shapes. Documents the dual auth model (operator JWT vs `x-awip-service-token`), `Idempotency-Key` semantics (currently honoured on `POST /okr/ingest`), the `api_call_logs` schema written on every call, and quick recipes for browser calls, cross-project service calls, and event-feed polling.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-06 — Capability detail page

### Added
- `GET /capabilities/:id/demand-detail` endpoint — returns a capability with the active KRs and tenants driving its demand.
- `src/pages/CapabilityDetail.tsx` — operator UI page consuming the new endpoint, reachable from the Control Plane demand board.
- Route wired up in `src/App.tsx`; demand board rows now link into the detail page.

### Changed
- `.lovable/plan.md` and `README.md` updated to reflect the new endpoint and page.

---

## [0.1.0] — initial v1 surface

### Added
- **Database** (Lovable Cloud / Postgres + RLS on every table)
  - OKR side: `tenants`, `okr_nodes`, `okr_measurements`, `okr_node_events`
  - Capability side: `capabilities`, `capability_connectors`, `capability_events`
  - Cross-cutting: `idempotency_keys`, `api_call_logs`, `user_roles`
  - `has_role()` `SECURITY DEFINER` function and `bootstrap_first_operator()` trigger so the first signup auto-promotes to operator + admin.
- **Contract API** (`supabase/functions/awip-api/index.ts`)
  - `GET  /capabilities` — manifest, optional `?status=` filter
  - `POST /capabilities/register` — module self-registration (upsert + emit `registered`)
  - `POST /okr/ingest` — idempotent OKR-tree ingestion
  - `POST /okr/:id/spawn` — spawn a sub-OKR with mandatory `spawned_from_reason`
  - `POST /okr/:id/supersede` — replace a node, preserving history
  - `GET  /okr/tree?tenant_id=…` — full tree including superseded
  - `GET  /events/recent` — merged OKR + capability event stream (`limit`, `since`, `tenant_id`)
  - `GET  /capabilities/demand` — capabilities ranked by `active_kr_count` then `tenant_count`; surfaces `unknown` capabilities referenced by KRs but never registered
  - Dual auth: operator JWT or `x-awip-service-token`. Every call logged to `api_call_logs`.
- **Operator UI**
  - Tenants, Capabilities, Events, API logs pages
  - Control Plane: demand board + live event feed (5s polling)
  - Auth flow gated on `operator` / `admin` role in `user_roles`

### Design rules established
1. Every OKR mutation emits an `okr_node_events` row.
2. Every manifest change emits a `capability_events` row.
3. All write endpoints are idempotent — same `Idempotency-Key` returns the original response.
4. No "who acts when" logic in Core — routing belongs in the Control Plane.
